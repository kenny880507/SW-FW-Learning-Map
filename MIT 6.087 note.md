# Lecture 1

## Evironment

Platform: Windows Subsystem for Linux
OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Complier: gcc (version 11.4.0)
Debugger: GNU gdb (version 12.1), valgrind (version 3.18.1)

Platform: Mac
OS: MacOS 15.6.1
Complier: gcc (version 15.2.0)
Debugger: gdb (version 16.3)

## Comiple

The standard compile command for WSL is below:

```bash
gcc -g -O0 -Wall <source>.c -o <executable-file>.o
```

The standard compile command for WSL is below:

```bash
gcc-15 -g -O0 -Wall <source>.c -o
 <executable-file>.o
```

Where the arguments have some denotation:

- `-g`: Embed debugging information in executable file. Debugger cann't work without this argument.
- `-O0`: Disable optimization.
- `-Wall`: Enables most compiler warnings.
- `-o`: Declare executable file name.

`<source>.c` is the source code. `<executable-file>.o` is the executable file. Although `.o` file is object file in general, it is defined as executable file in this course.

## Debug

To open executable file with debugger, use command below:

```bash
gdb <executable-file>.o
```

For memory debbuging, use valgrind:

```bash
valgrind <executable-file>.o
```

Here are some useful commands for the GDB console:

- `break <line-number>`: Create breakpoint at specified line.
- `break <file>:<line-number>`: Create breakpoint at line in file.
- `run`: Run program.
- `c`: Continue execution.
- `next`: Execute next line.
- `step`: Execute next line or step into function.
- `quit`: Quit gdb.
- `print <expression>`: Print current value of the specified expression.
- `help <command>`: In-program help.

## Macro

`#` is the notation in front of macro. Macro is used to create symbolic constants or inline code snippets that improve readability and reduce repetition. They are processed by the preprocessor before compilation.

The following table shows several commonly used macro:

| Macro | Syntax | Description | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `#include` | `#include <stdio.h>` or `#include "file.h"` | Reads the contents of a header file and inserts them into the current source file. | Angle brackets (<>) are for standard library headers; double quotes ("") check the current directory first. |
| `#define` | `#define msg "text"` or `#define add3(x,y,z) ((x)+(y)+(z))` | Defines a macro for text substitution. Can define constants or function-like expression macros. | Arguments in expression macros should be protected by parentheses to ensure order of operations. It performs inline replacement and is not suitable for recursion. |
| `#undef` | `#undef msg` | Removes the definition of a macro at compile time. | Used to restrict a macro's scope or to safely redefine a macro. |
| `#pragma` | `#pragma directive` | A preprocessor directive used to pass specific instructions to the compiler. | Often used to control compiler behavior (e.g., optimization or warnings). |
| `#error` | `#error <message>` | Triggers a custom compiler error, forcing compilation to stop. | Used to check if necessary preconditions (like macro definitions) are met before compilation continues. |
| `#warning` | `#warning <message>` | Triggers a custom compiler warning message. | Used to alert the developer to potential issues without halting the compilation process. |
| `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif` | `#ifdef MACRO` / `#if CONST_EXPR` / `#endif` | Conditional preprocessor macros used to control which lines of code are compiled. | Conditions must be preprocessor defines or literals (integer constant expressions), evaluated before the code is compiled. Often used in header files to prevent multiple inclusion. |

# Lecture 2

Key point:
- C is a weakly typed language. It allows implicit conversion and forced casting for datatypes.
- Operators specify how an object can be manipulated (e.g., numeric vs. string operations).
- `Big endian`: the most significant bits (MSBs) occupy the lower address. This representation is used in the powerpc processor. Networks generally use big-endian order, and thus it is called network order.
- `Little endian`: the least signficant bits (LSBs) occupy the lower address. This representation is used on all x86 compatible processors.
- Expression of constants:
  - Integer:
    - `int i = 3;`: `3` is an int by default.
    - `long i = 3;`: `3` is an int by default and is implicitly converted to long.
    - `unsigned long i = 3UL`: The postfix `UL` instructs the compiler to treat `3` as unsigned long.
    - `int i = 0xA`: The prefix `0x` indicates that contant `A` is a hexadecimal number.
    - `int i = 012`: The prefix `0` indicates that contant `12` is a octal number.
  - Floating Point:
    - `float pi = 3.14`: `3.14` is an float by default.
    - `float pi = 3.14f`: The prefix `f` indicates that contant `3.14` is float type.
    - `double pi = 3.14l`: The prefix `l` indicates that contant `3.14` is double type.
  - Character:
    - `'A'`: Character.
    - `'\x41'`: Character specified in hex.
    - `'0101'`: Character specified in octal.
  - String:
    - `"ab"`: String literal.
    - `"a""b"`: Same as `"ab"`.
  - Enumeration:
    - `enum BOLL{NO,YES}`: NO=0, YES=1.
    - `enum COLOR{R=1,G,B,Y=10}`: R=1, G=2, B=3, Y=10.

| unsigned char | 8 bits (1 Byte) (Common) | N/A | 0 ~ 255 |

# Lecture 3

## The *switch* statement

**Independent Case**

```C
switch ( ch ) {
  case 'Y': /* ch == 'Y' */
    /* do something */
    break ;
  case 'N' : /* ch == 'N' */
    /* do something else */
    break ;
  default : /* otherwise */
    /* do a third thing */
    break ;
}
```

**Falls Through Case**

When match found, starts executing inner code until `break;` reached. Execution "falls through" if `break;` not included.

```C
switch ( ch ) {
  case 'Y':
    /* do something if ch == 'Y' */
  case 'N' :
    /* do something if ch == 'Y' or ch == 'N' */
    break ;
}
```

## The do-while loop

Differs from `while` loop â€“ condition evaluated after each iteration.

```C
char c;
do{
  /* loop body */
  /* some processing */
} while (c == 'y'/* condition */); //<--the end semicolon is essential 
```

## The *extern* keyword

The `extern` keyword informs compiler that variable defined somewhere else enables access/modifying of global variable from other source files.

The `extern` is writed in a header file.

```C
// function.h
extern int global_var;
void some_fn(void);
```

The global variable is actually define in corresponding source file of the header file.

```C
// function.c
int global_var = 1;
void some_fn(void){
  ++global_var;
}
```

The global variable can be modify or access in other source file that include the header file.

```C
// main.c
#include "function.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  puts(global_var); // output>> 1
  some_fn();
  puts(global_var); // output>> 2
  global_var += 3;
  puts(global_var); // output>> 5
  return 0;
}
```

When compiler compile `main.c`, it needs a external reference of `global_var`.
Linker will let all references of `global_var` in `main.o` (comes from `main.c`) point to the only memory address which is distributed by `function.o` (comes from `function.c`).

## Compile with modules

If there are multiple modules is included, the source files need to be complie, too.
The following command is used to compile multiple source files:

```bash
gcc -g -O0 -Wall main.c <source-1>.c <source-2>.c -o output.o
```

## The *static* keyword

`static` keyword has two meanings, depending on where the static variable is declared:
  - Outside a function: `static` variables or functions can only be visible within that file, not globally (cannot be `extern`'ed).
  - Inside a function: The `static` variables are still local to the function. However, they are initialized only during program initialization.

```C
// function.c
void some_fn(void){
  static int var = 10;
  ++var;
}
```

The expression `static int var = 10;` may only be declared once when the program starts. After program initialization, the expression will `static int var = 10;` be ignored.

## The *register* keyword

Register is a kind of storage unit inside the CPU. The capacity of register is much smaller than RAM. Instead, it is extremely fast. When CPU execute some computation, data moves from RAM to register.

The C keyword `register` is used to optimize the performance of the program. However, there are some constraints:
  - The variable must be a simple type.
  - Only local variables and function arguments are eligible to use `register`.
  - `register` is a suggestion, not a requirement. Too many `register` declarations may be ignored, compiled as regular variables.
  - Registers do not reside in addressed memory. Pointer of a register is illegal.

# Lecture 4

## goto

`goto` provides a way to unconditionally jump to arbitrary position of code.

```C
for(...){
  for(...){
    /* some expression */
    if(condition) goto error;
  }
}
error:
/* keep going from gere */
```
**notice**: The readability of code decreases when the number of `goto` increases. More `goto` may cause debug harder.

## <stdio.h>

`int putchar(int)`: Puts the character on the standard output. Then, returns the character printed or EOF on error.
`int getchar()`: Returns the next character from standard input. If error occured, returns EOF.

If a executable file `a.out` needs standard input, `<` operator can use a file as standard input.

```bash
./a.out < file.txt
```

`int printf(char format[],arg1,arg2 ,...)` provides a formatted way to print variables. Returns the number of characters printed.

```C
printf("hello world\n");
printf("%d\n",10);
printf("Prices: %d and %d", 10, 20);
```

The `%` symbol can be followed by some components to specify the output format.

```C
%[flag][width][.precision][modifier]<type>
```

**flag:**

| format | output |
|---|---|
| printf ("%d, %+d, %+d",10, -10) | 10, +10, -10 |
| printf ("%04d",10) | 0010 |
| printf ("%7s", "hello") | bbhello |
| printf ("%-7s", "hello") | hellobb |

**width:**

| format | output |
|---|---|
| printf ("%d",10) | "10" |
| printf ("%4d",10) | bb10 (b:space) |
| printf ("%s","hello") | hello |
| printf ("%7s","hello") | bbhello |


**precision:**

| format | output |
|---|---|
| printf ("%.2f, %.0f", 1.141, 1.141) | 1.14, 1 |
| printf ("%.2e, %.0e", 1.141, 100.00) | 1.14e+00, 1e+02 |
| printf ("%.4s", "hello") | hell |
| printf ("%.1s", "hello") | h |

**modifier:**

| modifier | meaning |
|---|---|
| h | interpreted as short. Use with i,d,o,u,x |
| l | interpreted as long. Use with i,d,o,u,x |
| L | interpreted as double. Use with e,f,g |

**type:**

| Type | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| d, i | integer | printf ("%d", 10); /*prints 10*/ |
| x, X | integer (hex) | printf ("%x", 10); /*prints 0xa*/ |
| u | unsigned integer | printf ("%u", 10); /*prints 10*/ |
| c | character | printf ("%c", 'A'); /*prints A*/ |
| s | string | printf ("%s", "hello"); /*prints hello*/ |
| f | float | printf ("%f", 2.3); /*prints 2.3*/ |
| d | double | printf ("%d", 2.3); /*prints 2.3*/ |
| e, E | float(exp) | 1e3, 1.2E3, 1E-3 |
| % | literal % | printf ("%d %%", 10); /*prints 10%*/ |

`int scanf(char* format[],...)` is the input analog of printf. The format specification is the same as that for `printf()`.
  >**Important**: 
  > - `scanf()` ignores white spaces.
  > - Arguments have to be address of variables.

| printf | scanf |
|---|---|
| printf ("%d",x) | scanf ("%d",&x) |
| printf ("%10d",x) | scanf ("%d",&x) |
| printf ("%f",f) | scanf ("%f",&f) |
| printf ("%s",str) | scanf ("%s",str) /*note no & required*/ |
| printf ("%s",str) | scanf ("%20s",str) /*note no & required*/ |
| printf ("%s %s",fname,lname) | scanf ("%20s %20s",fname,lname) |

`printf` and `scanf` input data from either keyboard or file in command line. They have similar functions that input from string:

```C
int sprintf(char string [], char format[], arg1, arg2)
int sscanf(char str [], char format[], arg1, arg2)
```

C use `fopen()` to read data from text or binary files:

```C
FILE* fopen(char name[],char mode[])
```

- mode can be "r" (read only),"w" (write only),"a" (append) among other options.
- fopen returns a pointer to the file stream if it exists or `NULL` otherwise.
  
`fclose()` is used to close the stream (releases OS resources):

```C
int fclose(FILE* fp)
```

If the file stream `fp` is open.
- `getc()` reads a single character from stream.
- `fgets()` reads a single line.
- `putc()` writes a single character into stream.
- `fputs()` writes a single line.
- `fscanf` reads formated data from stream. Similar to `scanf()` and `sscanf()`.

```C
int getc(FILE* fp)
char[] fgets(char line [], int maxlen, FILE* fp)
int putc(int c, FILE* fp)
int fputs(char line [], FILE* fp)
int fscanf(FILE* fp, char format[], arg1, arg2)
```

`main()` can read the input from command line:

```C
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
```

| command line | argc | argv[0] | argv[1] | argv[2] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `./cat a.txt b.txt` | 3 | "cat" | "a.txt" | "b.txt" |
| `./cat` | 1 | "cat" | - | - |

# Lecture 5

## Memory

**Physical memory**: Physical resources where data can be stored and accessed by your computer
  - CPU cache
  - RAM
  - hard disk
  - removable device

**Virtual memory**: When program initializes, it may ask some memory address to store data. OS will distribute memory from RAM and hard disk to be the virtual memory. Virtual memory is sequence, and the virtual address starts from 0. 

Every variable residing in memory has an address except for
  - register variables
  - constants/literals/preprocessor defines
  - expressions (unless result is a variable)

`&` operator can access the address of variable. When data type is declared and followed by a `*`, it is a pointer of the data type.

```C
int n = 1; // n is a int variable
int* pn = &n; // pn is the pointer of n
double pi = 3.14; // pi is a double variable
double* ppi = &pi; // ppi is the pointer of pi
```

`*` operator followed by a pointer can dereference the pointer and access the value at corresponding address.

```C
printf("%d", *ppi); // output >> 3.14
```

Dereferenced pointer can operate just like variable.

```C
*ppi = *ppi + *pn; // pi is equal to 4.14 now
```

A pointer can be explicitly cast to any other type pointer by `()` operater.

```C
int var = 1;
int* p_int = &var;
double* p_double = (double*)p_int;
```

After above operation, `var` is still a `int` variable. Only when `p_double` is dereferenced that will treat the bits of `var` as `double`.

Functions can only return at most 1 variable in C. An alternative way to output multiple results is to pass pointers into the function.

```C
int a = 10, x, y;
int any_fn(a, &x, &y); // pass the pointers of x and y into function
```

Now `any_fn()` can modify the values of `x` and `y` by dereferencing the pointers.

Operator `sizeof()` is used to return size of type or variable in bytes.

```C
int int_size = sizeof(int); // int_size is 4 bytes in 64-bit system
int arr[8]; // arr is an integer array contains 8 integer element in sequential memory addresses
int arr_size = sizeof(arr); // arr_size is 32 (4 times 8) bytes
```

When `arr` is called without `[]` or `*` operator, it returns a pointer points to the first element of the array. `arr[i]` returns the i-th (i starts from 0) element and is equivalent to `*(arr+i)`. As mentioned above, `arr` is a pointer, and `arr+i` returns the i-th address behind the `arr`.

```C
int* parr = arr; // assume pa = 0x00
int a = arr[3]; // a equals to the int value stored in 0x0C
```

`<string.h>` contains some useful function for string manupulation:
  - `char* strcpy(strto,strfrom)`: Copy `strfrom` to `strto`.
  - `char* strncpy(strto,strfrom,n)`: Copy `n` chars from`strfrom` to `strto`.
  - `int strcmp(str1,str2)`: Compare `str1` and `str2`. Return 0 if equal, positive if `str1>str2`, negative if `str1<str2`.
  - `int strncmp(ste1,str2,n)`: Compare first `n` element of `str1` and `str2`.
  - `int strlen(str)`: Returns the length of `str`.
  - `char* strcat(strto,strfrom)`: Add `strfrom` to the end of `strto`.
  - `char* strncat(strto,strfrom,n)`: Add n chars from `strfrom` to the end of `strto`.
  - `char* strchr(str,c)`: Find char `c` in `str`. Returns pointer to the first occurrence, or `NULL` if not found.
  - `char* strrchr(str,c)`: Find char `c` in `str`. Returns pointer to the last occurrence, or `NULL` if not found.

## Quick sort

Quick sort is used to sort an array. It has average time comlexity `O(nlogn)` and worst time comlexity `O(n^2)`.

There are three main step of quick sort:
  1. Choose a pivot (the mid point generally), and classify the array into two. The left part consists of the elements smaller than the pivot, and the right part constists of the elements larger than the pivot.
  2. Quick sort the left part.
  3. Quick sort the right part.

The code of quick sort in recursive way is shown below:

```C
void quick_sort(int* left, int* right){
  if(left>=right) return;
  int pivot = *(left+(right-left)/2);
  swap(left,left+(right-left)/2);
  int* current, left_current = left;
  for(currrent=left+1;current<=right;++current)
    if(*current<pivot) swap(current,++left_current);
  int* mid = left_current;
  swap(mid,left);
  if(left_current>left) quick_sort(left,mid-1);
  if(left_current<right) quick_sort(mid+1,right);
}
```

# Lecture 6

## Structure

A `struct` defines a new datatype. The variables declared within a `struct` are called its `members`. Individual members can be accessed using `.` operator.

```C
struct new_type{
  int member1;
  float member2;
  // ...
};
struct new_type a={10, 3.14f};
struct new_type* pa = &a;
int b = a.member1;
float c = pa->member2;
```

`typedef` can be used to simply the syntax of struct declaration.

```C
struct new_type{
  int member1;
  float member2;
  // ...
};
typedef struct new_type NewType;
NewType a={10, 3.14f};
NewType* pa = &a;
int b = a.member1;
float c = pa->member2;
```

or

```C
typedef struct{
  int member1;
  float member2;
  // ...
}NewType;
NewType a={10, 3.14f};
NewType* pa = &a;
int b = a.member1;
float c = pa->member2;
```

The name of the structure is optional. A `struct` without type name is called anonymous struct. Anonymous struct must declare at least one variable at the end of definition.

```C
struct{
  int member1;
  float member2;
  // ...
}a, b, c;
```

In the above example, `a`, `b`, `c` is the only 3 three variables of this `struct`.

The size of a `struct` is greater than or equal to the sum of the sizes of its `members`. The arrangement of members is sequential in the memory. However, it might be filled by some useless bytes to match the specific alignment of memory for the consideration of CPU efficiency.


## Union

A `union` is a datatype that may hold objects of different types/sizes in the same memory location.

```C
union data{
  int i;
  float f;
  char* s;
};
union data d1;
d1.i = 10; // d1 stores int data;
d1.f = 2.1f;  // the int data in d1 is overwrited by float data;
```

The size of a `union` is the largest size of the members. `union` may only store the last assignment. However, you can read the data as other datatype. Using `char[]` is one way to inspect or manipulate the bytes of raw data.

## Bit field

A `bit-field` is a set of adjacent bits.

```C
unsigned int BOOL:1; // use a bit to represent for true or false
```

`unsigned int` is a convention that can prevent sign bit.

Another purpose of `bit-field` is to save the memory. If a variable only stores an integer ranges from 1 to 10, a large portion of `int` bytes will be wasted. Instead, using only 4-bit `int` to store it may be a reasonable way.

## Dynamic memory allocation

`void* malloc(size_t size)`:
  - Returns a pointer to **uninitialized** block of memory on success.
  - Returns NULL on failure.
  - The returned value should be cast to appropriate type. `int* ptr=(int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*100)`

`void* calloc(size_t n, size_t size)`:
  - Allocates an array of `n` elements each of which is `size` bytes.

`void* free(void*)`:
  - Frees memory allocated by `malloc()`.

# Lecture 7

## Struct: the order of member matters

The order of member may influence the memory size of the `struct`.

```C
struct foo{
  short s; // 2 bytes + 2 padding bytes = 4 bytes
  union{ // 4 bytes
    int i; // size of union determined by int
    char c;
  }u;
  unsigned int flag_s:1; // 1 bit
  unsigned int flag_u:2; // 2 bit, align with flag_s and pad to 4 bytes
  unsigned int bar; // 4 bytes
}
```

As the above example, total size of `foo` is 4+4+4+4=16 bytes. However, if the order of the `struct` changes, total size of `foo` can reduce to 12 bytes.

```C
struct foo{
  union{ // 4 bytes
    int i; // size of union determined by int
    char c;
  }u;
  unsigned int bar; // 4 bytes
  // below 3 members are aligned in 4 bytes
  short s; // 2 bytes
  unsigned int flag_s:1; // 1 bit
  unsigned int flag_u:2; // 2 bit
}
```

## Pointer array

There is an `int` array contains 100 elements.

```C
int arr[100];
```

If we want to sort the array without modifying array itself. We can use a pointer array `int*` containing pointers to elements of array and sort the pointers.

```C
int* ptr[100];
```

An array of strings stores pointers to the first `char` address (which is also a pointer) of each string.

```C
char str1[] = "hello";
char str2[] = "goodbye";
char* strArr[] = {str1,str2};
```

## Multidimensional arrays

C also permits multidimensional arrays:

```C
int arr[20][30]; // a 20x30 int array
```

Multidimensional arrays are rectangular; pointer arrays can be arbitrary shaped.

## Prefix, infix, postfix notation

Stacks and queues allow us to design a simple expression evaluator.

| Infix | Prefix | Postfix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A+B | +AB | AB+|
| A*B+C | -*ABC | AB*C- |
| (A+B)*(C-D) | *+AB-CD | AB+CD-* |

Infix more natural to write, postfix easier to evaluate.

## Void pointers

C allows `void` pointers. Void pointers can be used to point to any data type.

```C
int i;
void* pi = &i;
float f;
void* pf = &f;
```

`void` pointers cannot be dereferenced. The pointers should always be cast before dereferencing. 

```C
void* p;
printf("%d",*p); // invalid
printf("%d",*(int*)p); // valid
```

## Function pointers

In some programming languages, functions are first class variables (can be passed to functions, returned from functions etc.).

In C, function itself is not a variable. But it is possible to declare pointer to functions.

```C
int (*pf)(int);
```

## Callback

Definition: Callback is a piece of executable code passed to functions. In C, callbacks are implemented by passing function pointers.

```C
void qsort(void* arr, int num, int size, int (*fp)(void* pa, void* pb))
```

`qsort()` function from the standard library can sort an array of any datatype. It calls a function whenever a comparison needs to be done. The function takes two arguments and returns (<0,0,>0) depending on the relative order of the two items.

```C
int arr[] = {10,9,8,1,2,3,5};
int asc(void* pa, void* pb){
  return (*(int*)pa-*(int*)pb);
}
int desc(void* pa, void* pb){
  return (*(int*)pb-*(int*)pa);
}
qsort(arr,sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int),sizeof(int),asc); // sort in ascending order
qsort(arr,sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int),sizeof(int),desc); // sort in descending order
```

## Array of function pointers

Consider the case where different functions are called based on a value.

```C
enum TYPE{SQUARE,RECT,CIRCILE,POLYGON};
struct shape {
float params[MAX];
enum TYPE type;
};

void draw(struct shape* ps){
  switch(psâˆ’>type){
    case SQUARE:
    draw_square(ps); break;
    case RECT:
    draw_rect(ps); break;
    //...
  }
} 
```

The same can be done using an array of function pointers instead.

```C
void (*fp[4])(struct shape* ps)={&draw_square,&draw_rec,&draw_circ,&draw_poly};
void draw(struct shape* ps){
  fp[ps->type](ps);
}
```

## Symbols and libraries

Programs access librariesâ€™ functions and variables via identifiers known as symbols. Header file declarations/prototypes mapped to symbols at compile time. Symbols linked to definitions in external libraries during linking.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

const char msg[] = "hello world!";

int main(void){
  puts(msg);
  return 0;
}
```

The functions `main()`, `puts()` and the variable `msg` are global and known as symbols.

The following command can produce `.o` file without linking:

```bash
gcc -Wall -c hello.c -o hello.o
```

- `-c`: compile without linking. The output `.o` file is not executable.
- Addresses for lines of code and static and global variables not yet assigned.
- Need to perform link step on `.o` (using `gcc` or `ld`) to assign memory to each symbol.
- Linking resolves symbols defined elsewhere and makes the code executable.

Use `nm` (Name List) command to list all symbols in the binary file.

```bash
nm hello.o
```

The output will be:

```bash
0000000000000000 T main
0000000000000000 R msg
                 U puts
```

- `T` means text (code). `R` means read-only memory. `U` means undefined symbol.
- Addresses are all zero before linking, and symbols are not allocated memory yet.
- Undefined symbols are defined externally and resolved during linking.

Instead, if we compile with linking:

```bash
gcc -Wall hello.o -o hello
nm hello
```

The output will be:

```bash
.
.
.
0000000000001149 T main
0000000000002008 R msg
                 U puts@GLIBC_2.2.5
```

- Addresses for static (allocated at compile time) symbols.
- Symbol `puts` located in shared library GLIBC_2.2.5 (GNU C standard library)
- Shared symbol `puts` not assigned memory until run time.
